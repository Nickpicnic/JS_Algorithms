# Graph Traversal
* Visiting / Updating / Checking *each vertex in a graph*

* **Graph Traversal Uses:**
    - Peer to peer networking
    - Web crawlers
    - Finding "closest"
    - Matches / recomendations
    - Shortest path problems:
        - GPS Navigation
        - Solving mazes
        - AI (shortest path to win the game)

* **Depth First Graph Traversal**
- implementation *graph.js*
    - Explore as far as possible down one branch one branch before 'backtracking'
    - Recursive
    - Iterative

* **Breadth First Graph Traversal**
    - Visit neighbors at current depth first!
