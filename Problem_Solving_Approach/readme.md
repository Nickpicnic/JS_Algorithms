# Problem Solving
* How do you improve?
    - **Devise** a plan for solving problems.
    - **Master** common problem solving patterns

    - **Problem solving:**  
        - Understand the Problem
        - Explore Concrete Examples
        - Break It Down
        - Solve / Simplify
        - Look Back and Refactor


* **Step 1:** Understand the Problem
    *(from book: Geoge Polya - "How To Solve It")*
    - Can i restate the problem **in my own words**?
    - What are the **inputs** that go into the problem?
    - What are the **outputs** that should come from the solution to the problem?
    - Can the **outputs** be determined from the **inputs**? 
    - Do i have **enough information** to solve the problem?
    - How should I label **the important pieces of data** that are a part of the problem?

* **Step2:** Concrete Examples
    - Start with **Simple Examples**
    - Progress to **More Complex Examples**
    - Explore Examples with **Empty Inputs**
    - Explore Examples with **Invalid Inputs**
    
* **Step 3:** Break It Down
    - Explicitly write out the steps you need to take!

* **Step 4:** Solve or Simplify
    - Simplify: 
        - Find the **core difficulty** in what you're trying to do
        - Temporarily **ignore** that difficulty 
        - Write a **simplified solution**
        - Then **incorporate** that difficulty back in

* **Step 5:** Look Back and Refactor
    - Refactoring Questions:
        - Can you **check** the result?
        - Can you **derive** the result differently?
        - Can you **understand** it at a glance?
        - Can you **use** the result or method for **some other problem**?
        - Can you **improve** the performance of your solution?
        - Can you **think** of other ways to refactor?
        - How have **other people** solved this problem?
