# Data Structures Beginning
* **ES2015 CLASS SYNTAX**
    * **What is a class?**
        - A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined propeties and methods

    * Data Structures: **The Class Keyword**
        - **The Syntax**
            *example in student.js*
            - The method to create new object **must** be called constructor.
            - The class keyword **creates a constant**, so you can not redefine it. Watch out for the syntax as well!

        - **Creating objects from classes**
            *We use the **new** keyword*
            *example in student.js*
            
    * Data Structures: **Adding Instance Methods**
        - **Instance Methods**
            *example in student.js*

    * Data Structures: **Adding Class Methods**
        - **Class Methods**
            *example in student.js*
            *example in point.js*
            - **static** keyword

        - **How we'll be using classes**
            *code in dataStructure.js*
            - *We will using the **constructor** and **instance methods** quite a bit! (in this course)*

        - **This**
            - Inside all of our **instance** methods and **constructor**, the keyword *this* refers to the object created from that class (also known as an **instance**)
