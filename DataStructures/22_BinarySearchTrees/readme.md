# Binary Search Trees
* **Trees**
    - What is a **Tree**?
        - A data structure that consists of nodes in a **parent / child** relationship
        - *implementation bsts.js*
    - **Difference**
        - Lists - **linear**
        - Trees - **nonlinear**
    - **Terminology**
        - **Root** - The top node in a tree.
        - **Child** - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
        - **Parent** - The converse notion of a child.
        - **Siblings** - A group of nodes with the same parent.
        - **Leaf** - A node with no children.
        - **Edge** - The connection between one node and another.

* **Uses For Trees**
    - Lots of different applications!
        - HTML DOM JSON
        - Network Routing
        - Abstract Syntax Tree
        - Artificial Intelligence
        - Folders in Operationg Systems

* **Binary Trees**
    - Kinds of Trees: 
        - Trees
        - Binary Trees
        - Binary Search Trees

    - **How BSTS Work**
        - Every parent node has at most **two** children
        - Every node **to the left** of a parent node is **always less** than the parent
        - Every node **to the right** of a parent node is **always greater** than the parent.
    
* **Big O of BST**
    - Insertion 
        - **O(log n)** *average*
        - **O(n)** *worst case*
    - Searching 
        - **(Olog n)** *average*
        - **O(n)** *worst case*
